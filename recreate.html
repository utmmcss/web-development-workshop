	Web development is a lot of fun and isn't too <sub>difficult</sub> to pick up
	(with practice of course).  It is a <i>great skill</i> to have, and 
	nowadays, having an online presence is <strong>important</strong>.  You can 
	<sup>document</sup> your skills in a <b>personal website</b>, maintain a <b>blog</b>,
	and so much more!

	<h2>What is a div?</h2>
	<p>
	The div element separates code into neat chunks that are easy to work with.
	Everything with the class "first" (as in our case) can be styled in 
	the same way as it is in one "div".  You'll really appreciate the
	usefulness of "div" when we go through CSS.
